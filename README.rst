====================================
**RxP** - Reliable Transfer Protocol
====================================

===================================
**FxA** - File Transfer Application
===================================
FxA Server
----------

**Command-line**::

    > FxA-server X A P

    + X: the port number at which the FxA-server’s UDP socket should bind to (odd number)
    + A: the IP address of NetEmu
    + P: the UDP port number of NetEmu

**Command**:

+ Configure receiver maximum transfer window for the server::

    > window W

    - W: the maximum receiver’s window-size at the FxA-Server (in segments).

+ Shut down FxA-Server gracefully::

    > terminate


FxA Client
----------

**Command-line**::

    > FxA-client X A P

    + X: the port number at which the FxA-client’s UDP socket should bind to (even number). Please remember that this port number should be equal to the server’s port number minus 1.

    + A: the IP address of NetEmu

    + P: the UDP port number of NetEmu

**Command**:

+ The FxA-client connects to the FxA-server (running at the same IP host)::

    > connect

+ The FxA-client downloads file from the server::

    > get F

    - F: the file to be downloaded (if F exists in the same directory with the FxA-server program)

+ The FxA-client uploads file to the server::

    > post F

    - F: the file to be uploaded (if F exists in the same directory with the FxA-client program)

+ Configure maximum receiver window size for the client::

    > window W

    - W: the maximum receiver’s window-size at the FxA-Client (in segments).

+ The FxA-client terminates gracefully from the FxA-server::

    > disconnect
